## The Problem

<!-- What's frustrating? What's missing? What would make someone's life better?
     Start with the person, not the feature. "As a customer, I can't..." -->

## The Solution

<!-- How should it work? Describe the experience you want to create. Be specific — what does the user see, tap, or hear? -->

## Why This Matters

- **Who benefits:** [e.g., customers, suppliers, admins]
- **Scale of impact:** [e.g., every user, specific city, edge case]
- **Priority:** [Low / Medium / High]

## Alternatives You've Considered

<!-- Have you thought about other ways to solve this? What are the trade-offs? -->

## User Experience

<!-- If this is a UI feature: -->
- **Screen/Page:** [e.g., Home, Booking, Supplier Dashboard]
- **Interaction:** [e.g., tap, voice, swipe]
- **Accessibility:** How does this work for someone who can't read English? For a screen reader user?

## Technical Considerations

<!-- Optional — if you've thought about implementation: -->
- **API changes:** Any new endpoints needed?
- **Data model:** Any Firestore schema changes?
- **Performance:** Caching, rate limiting, or scaling implications?

## Mockups or References

<!-- Sketches, screenshots, links to similar features in other products — anything visual helps. -->
