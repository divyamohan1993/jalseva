# Code of Conduct

JalSeva exists because 163 million people in India don't have reliable access to clean water. That mission is bigger than any one of us.

To build something this important, we need a community where everyone — regardless of who they are or where they come from — feels safe to contribute, challenge ideas, and do their best work.

This is how we do that.

## The Standard

**Be excellent to each other.** That means:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback
- Take responsibility — and apologize when you get it wrong
- Focus on what's best for the community and the mission

**What we won't tolerate:**

- Sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They will take fair corrective action in response to behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all community spaces — issues, PRs, discussions, and any public space where you represent JalSeva.

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to the project maintainers at **contact@dmj.one**. All complaints will be reviewed promptly, fairly, and confidentially.

## Why This Matters

We're building technology that serves people who are often overlooked — low-literacy users, rural communities, people who have never used an app before. The way we treat each other in this community should reflect the same care we put into the product.

**Build with respect. Ship with purpose.**
